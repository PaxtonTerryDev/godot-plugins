# Gameplay Ideas
Turn based spellcasting game. Kind of like the gameplay in Mewgenics or War Worlds? I think it's called?

Can have various different movement abilities, etc.

Easily scope the abilities / spells to movement on the tiles.  

Could also include other "classes" as well that can interact with the tile system differently

Limited in npc interactions depending on the level of your different skills 

found weapons / items can have imbued abilities, like they offer special abilities or attributes
